### ðŸ›  **Concepts & Architecture**  
âœ… **Layered Architecture** â†’ The application is structured into layers:  
- **Controller Layer** â†’ Exposes the APIs  
- **Service Layer** â†’ Contains the business logic  
- **Repository Layer** â†’ Interacts with the database  

âœ… **SOLID Principles** â†’ The application follows best practices to ensure scalability and maintainability.  
âœ… **Dependency Injection (DI)** â†’ Object instance management is handled by Spring, ensuring **loosely coupled components**.  
âœ… **Design Patterns** â†’  
- **Builder Pattern** â†’ Used in DTOs for object creation  
- **Repository Pattern** â†’ Separates database logic from application logic  

âœ… **Role-based security system** â†’ Using **Spring Security**, each user has a role with specific permissions.  
âœ… **SQL Database** â†’ A relational database is used for data persistence.
